## Voting dApp integration guidelines

* Single POST method:
  * Request voting tokens from API passing my address
  * (Optional) Pass data and signature as well
* Use these tokens to interact with the tokenized ballot
* All other interactions must be made directly on-chain

---

## Homework

* Create Github Issues with your questions about this lesson
* Finish the integration

---

## Weekend Project

* Form groups of 3 to 5 students
* Complete the projects together
* Create a voting dApp to cast votes, delegate and query results on chain
* Request voting tokens to be minted using the API
* (bonus) Store a list of recent votes in the backend and display that on frontend
